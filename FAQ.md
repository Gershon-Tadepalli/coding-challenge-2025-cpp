# FAQ

### Do I have to care about runtime?
While performance is not the primary concern of the challenge and is not considered by the scoring function, our server uses a 2 minute timeout for each test case. 
Due to different data sets, hardware and execution environment you can not assume a similar runtime as on your machine.
As the chosen timeout is quite generous, a reasonable solution should not run into issues.

### How do you ensure a fair competition?
The evaluator code has several safety measures, including WASM based Sandboxing, in place. This repository contains only a simplified version of the true evaluation.

### Who can participate?
Everyone is encouraged to participate.

### What are the rules of the competition?
You can find the detailed [Rules](https://github.com/tumuchdata/coding-challenge-2025/releases/download/v0.1.0/tnc-coding-challenge.pdf) of the competition on the contest website.

### How many points are possible?
A perfect theoretical index, capable of avoiding all block scans while having a memory footprint of 0 bytes would achieve a score of 109'051'904. In the real world, this score is of course unachievable, but a helpful upper bound.
